# Project Overview

This project was completed as part of COMP 432 – Machine Learning at Concordia University in a team of three students.

The objective was to build and optimize a multi-class classification model to identify 50 different household objects using pre-extracted deep learning feature vectors instead of raw images.

The competition was hosted on Kaggle and evaluated using accuracy score, allowing teams to benchmark performance in a competitive academic setting.

Final ranking: 7th out of 44 teams

Final accuracy: 0.835
